# Developing DragonValorUSRecomp

How this repo is built, run and debugged on the machine it was brought up on
(Windows 11). Project state and known issues live in [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md).

## Prerequisites

| Need | Where |
|---|---|
| Git for Windows (`bash` on PATH for the framework scripts) | `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` |
| Python 3.12+ (3.13 used) with Pillow (used by the test helpers) | system |
| RetroPorting toolchain: cmake 3.31, ninja, clang 22 | `C:\retcomm-toolchain` (unzipped `cmake-clang-v1-windows-x64.zip`) |

Every build shell needs the toolchain first on `PATH` and the framework told
where it is:

```bash
# Git Bash
export PATH="/c/retcomm-toolchain/bin:$PATH" PSXRECOMP_TOOLCHAIN_DIR="/c/retcomm-toolchain"
```
```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:Path = "C:\retcomm-toolchain\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\bin;$env:Path"
$env:PSXRECOMP_TOOLCHAIN_DIR = "C:\retcomm-toolchain"
```

Discs are not in the repo. `game.toml` names them by Redump file name only
(`Dragon Valor (USA) (Disc N).cue`): the launcher asks the player for each
image and remembers it in `settings.toml`; the multi-disc roster matches a disc
by its file-name stem, so dumps must keep the Redump names. On this machine the
dumps live in `F:\dragon-valor-recomp\Dragon Valor (USA) (Disc N)\`; scripted
runs pass `--disc` (`tools/dvdbg.py launch` does, or `DVDBG_DISC=<cue>`).

## Build

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive        # psxrecomp, recomp-ui, nested libs

# 1. recompiler + BIOS emitters (once per framework bump) -> build-recompiler/
bash psxrecomp/tools/ci/build_emitters.sh

# 2. game C from the disc (only when seeds or the framework pin change) -> generated/
python psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py generate --config game.toml --project-root . \
    --disc "../Dragon Valor (USA) (Disc 1)/Dragon Valor (USA) (Disc 1).cue"

# 3a. player build (no debug server)            -> build-release/DragonValorUS_Recompiled.exe
python psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py rebuild --config game.toml --project-root . \
    --build-dir build-release --no-pgo

# 3b. debug build (TCP debug server on :4370)   -> build-debug/DragonValorUS_Recompiled.exe
python psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py rebuild --config game.toml --project-root . \
    --build-dir build-debug --no-pgo --cmake-extra=-DPSX_DEBUG_TOOLS=ON
```

Notes:
- `rebuild` forces `-DPSX_DEBUG_TOOLS=OFF`; the `--cmake-extra` in 3b is what
  turns the debug server on (later flags win).
- `generated/` is deterministic (35 shards, 1,302,445 lines, 1962 dispatch
  entries). It is committed; regenerate and commit together with the seed or
  pin change that caused it.
- `game.toml` / `game_options.toml` are re-staged next to the exe by the
  always-run `psx-stage-configs` target. After editing only `game.toml`, run
  `ninja -C build-release psx-stage-configs` (and the same for `build-debug`)
  or a full rebuild.
- Only OpenBIOS is linked (no retail BIOS C is generated).
- `generated/overlays_static*.c` is the AOT shard for the `BIN/*.BIN` mode
  modules; `generate` rebuilds it from `aot/overlays.json` (see [`AOT.md`](AOT.md)).

## Run

- `Play.bat` — player launch (`build-release`). `Play.bat -dbg` uses `build-debug`.
- `PlayDebug.bat` — debug build with the debug server and the FPS readout on.
- `PlaySmooth.bat` — release build with `PSX_RENDER_THREAD=1 PSX_FRAME_GEN=1`
  (`[video] render_thread` / `frame_generation`; `PSX_FRAME_GEN_METHOD=redraw|reprojection`).
  NTSC title: the guest runs at 60 Hz, generation only adds presented frames.
- Both open the **recomp-ui launcher** first (disc check, Disc 1/2, pad mode,
  memory cards, Settings, Mods). `--no-launcher` or `PSX_NO_LAUNCHER=1` boots
  straight into the game.

Files the runtime writes, all gitignored:

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Memory cards | `saves/card1.mcd`, `saves/card2.mcd` (project root, `[runtime] memcard_dir`) |
| Launcher/user settings | `settings.toml` next to the exe (overrides `game.toml` defaults) |
| Keyboard binds | `keybinds.ini` next to the exe (generated on first run) |
| Host hotkeys / pad mapping | `config.ini` next to the exe (`[KeyMap]`, `[controller]`, `[mapping]`) |
| Overlay captures + native shards | `overlay_captures.json(.d)` and `cache/` next to the exe |
| Exit report / watchdog | `psx_last_run_report.json` (unknown dispatches, segment misses, overlay loader counters, CPU state at exit), `psx_freeze_heartbeat.json`, boot-time `psx_freeze_dump_*.json` (false positives, ~35 MB each — delete) |

## Debugging a running game

The debug build listens on `127.0.0.1:4370` (JSON lines; see
`psxrecomp/docs/TCP_COMMANDS.md`). Two clients:

```bash
# project helper (launches muted and detached, skips the launcher)
python tools/dvdbg.py launch            # OpenGL on 4370
python tools/dvdbg.py launch --sw       # software renderer on 4371
python tools/dvdbg.py press start cross down:8
python tools/dvdbg.py shot out.png      # guest display
python tools/dvdbg.py pad               # SIO pad: connected / analog / type
python tools/dvdbg.py health            # unknown dispatches + segment misses (must stay 0)
python tools/dvdbg.py raw video_info
python tools/dvdbg.py kill

# framework client (every command, key=value pass-through)
python psxrecomp/tools/debug_client.py --port 4370 frame
python psxrecomp/tools/debug_client.py --port 4370 press 0xFFF7 10      # Start, active-low word
python psxrecomp/tools/debug_client.py --port 4370 screenshot C:\tmp\a.png
python psxrecomp/tools/debug_client.py --port 4370 pad_status
python psxrecomp/tools/debug_client.py --port 4370 accurate_blending on=0
python psxrecomp/tools/debug_client.py --port 4370 debug_key key=1      # cycle internal scale
```

Useful facts:
- PS1 pad words are active-low: Start `0xFFF7`, Cross `0xBFFF`, Down `0xFFBF`.
- `ping` is answered by the io-thread variant without counters; use `frame`,
  `unknown_dispatch_log`, `segment_misses`, `pad_status`.
- `debug_key` only reaches the 0-9 / F10-F12 video toggles. The F key (FPS
  readout) is keyboard-only; `PSX_FPS_TELEMETRY=1` turns it on at start.
- `psxrecomp/tools/window_capture.py --title DragonValor --series 6` gives a
  LIVE/FROZEN verdict from what the monitor shows (screenshots come from VRAM
  and can lie about a frozen window).

### Save states

The runtime's save states (`savestate op=save|load slot=N`) are the shortcut
around the ~5 min intro, and **every automated test that is not about the
boot or the menus starts from slot 0**:

```bash
python tools/dvdbg.py launch --state 0  # boot, then load slot 0 and wait for it
python tools/dvdbg.py state load 0      # same thing on a running instance
python tools/dvdbg.py state save 0      # overwrite the slot from the running game
python tools/dvdbg.py state keep 0      # copy the slot into tests/states/ (committed)
```

Slot 0 is the first screen of gameplay (New Game → prologue → opening
cutscene → first enemy in Brize Forest; HP 030/030, MP 020/020). The runtime
reads slots from `saves/openbios/` (gitignored); the committed copy lives in
[`tests/states/`](../tests/states/README.md) and `state load` restores it
from there when the local slot is missing, so a fresh clone needs nothing
else. The state carries the loaded `ACTION.BIN`, so no part of the menu
route is replayed. States are whole-machine state: same BIOS (OpenBIOS),
same disc, and a runtime update that changes the format means re-taking
them (`state save`, then `state keep`).

### Known RAM addresses (USA EXE)

Found by pattern search over `read_ram` and confirmed by `write_ram` in slot 0
(the HUD counts toward the new value):

| Address | Width | Meaning | Referenced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x8008A5AE` | u16 | HP current | `func_800389F4`, `func_80038F0C` |
| `0x8008A5B0` | u16 | HP max | |
| `0x8008A5B2` | u16 | MP current | |
| `0x8008A5B4` | u16 | MP max | `func_80034908` |

`write_ram` writes one byte per call (`addr=`, `val=`). The GameShark codes
circulating online (`800A5AE0 0064`, `800A5B20 0064`, …) are these addresses
with one hex digit dropped; their `800A2DD0 2700` (Val) did not change the
Val shown on the Status screen here, so it is not confirmed.

### Play sessions

Start `PlayDebug.bat`, then `python tools/session_monitor.py <out_dir>`: every
30 s it logs frame, fps, unknown dispatches, segment misses and pad mode to
`monitor.csv`, dumps the unknown-dispatch tail whenever a new address appears
(seed material), screenshots every 5 min, and stops when the game closes.

## Test conventions

- **Start from slot 0.** `python tools/dvdbg.py launch --state 0` (see *Save
  states* above). Replaying the intro is only for boot/menu tests.
- **Run muted.** `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=dummy` (+ `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`) — the
  SPU still runs. `PSX_HOST_MUTE=1` is documented but not read by this runtime.
- **One instance per port.** Several instances are fine with `--debug-port N`;
  the OpenGL instance tends to settle at internal scale 1x when sharing the GPU.
- **Comparing renderers frame-exact.** Instances started from the same Start
  press run deterministically, offset by a constant frame count (difference of
  the frames at which Start was pressed). Sample `screenshot` every second,
  name files by `frame`, and pair GL/SW by that offset; PIL luma timelines find
  transitions quickly. This is how the dissolve finding in `STATUS.md` was made.
- **Attract route.** Boot → Start once (skips the FMV) → leave the title alone:
  story movie → main menu → gameplay demo (dungeon, dragon arena), looping.
  A second Start on the title goes to the menu; a Start on the menu starts a
  New Game.
